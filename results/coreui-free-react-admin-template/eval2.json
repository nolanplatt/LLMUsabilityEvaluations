      "Is the system providing appropriate feedback?": "No, feedback is only present during initial route suspense load; user actions like form submissions do not reflect system feedback clearly.",
      "Is the language understandable and uses real-world conventions?": "Yes, standard phrases like 'Search' and 'You\u2019re lost' are used appropriately.",
      "Can users easily undo and redo actions?": "No, the interface lacks undo/redo functionality for most interactions.",
      "Are there consistent standards across the system?": "Yes, consistent use of CoreUI components throughout ensures uniform design.",
      "Is the design preventing problems before they occur?": "No, lack of confirmation modals or pre-validation may allow users to make erroneous actions without checks.",
      "Is recognition prioritized over recall?": "Yes, menus and iconography reduce cognitive load by making options visible.",
      "Is the interface flexible and efficient for both novices and experts?": "Partially, while the layout is clean, there's limited shortcut or efficiency features for power users.",
      "Is the design aesthetically pleasing and minimal?": "Yes, the template uses a clean, responsive layout with appropriate spacing and minimal visual clutter.",

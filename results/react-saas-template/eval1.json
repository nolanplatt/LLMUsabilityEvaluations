    "IssueDescription": "The UI provides some feedback mechanisms such as spinner icons (e.g., in AccountInformationArea) and Material-UI Snackbars, but there is limited status feedback for page loads, network delays, or background operations.",

    "EvaluationAnswers": {
      "Is the system providing appropriate feedback?": "Partially. Spinners and icon animations indicate state changes but overall system status (e.g., loading states, save confirmation) is limited.",
      "Is the language understandable and uses real-world conventions?": "Yes. Terms like 'Activated', 'Balance', and 'Settings' are intuitive.",
      "Can users easily undo and redo actions?": "No. There is no visible undo/redo support for actions like settings or data input.",
      "Are there consistent standards across the system?": "Yes. The MUI framework ensures consistent component design.",
      "Is the design preventing problems before they occur?": "Moderately. Some read-only components help prevent errors.",
      "Is recognition prioritized over recall?": "Yes. Information is presented visually without requiring memory.",
      "Is the interface flexible and efficient for both novices and experts?": "Yes. Clean layout with intuitive navigation.",
      "Is the design aesthetically pleasing and minimal?": "Yes. Follows Material Design with ample whitespace.",
      "Are error messages helpful and expressed in plain language?": "Not fully tested. Few user-generated error states found.",

    "EvaluationAnswers": {
      "Is the system providing appropriate feedback?": "No. The navigation links use a static 'is-active' class and do not update dynamically when scrolling.",
      "Is the language understandable and uses real-world conventions?": "Yes. Labels like 'Home', 'Portfolio', and 'Contact' are intuitive.",
      "Can users easily undo and redo actions?": "No. There is no undo/redo capability or clear history tracking in the static page.",
      "Are there consistent standards across the system?": "Yes. Navigation and layout are consistent across the site.",
      "Is the design preventing problems before they occur?": "No. Without visual feedback during navigation, users may be confused.",
      "Is recognition prioritized over recall?": "Yes. Navigation is visible and labels are descriptive.",
